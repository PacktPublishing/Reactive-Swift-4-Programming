# Reactive Programming with Swift 4
This is the code repository for [Reactive Programming with Swift 4](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/reactive-programming-swift-4?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787120211), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
RxSwift belongs to a large family of Rx implementations in different programming languages that share almost identical syntax and semantics. Reactive approach will help you to write clean, cohesive, resilient, scalable, and maintainable code with highly configurable behavior.

This book will introduce you to the world of reactive programming, primarily focusing on mobile platforms. It will tell how you can benefit from using RxSwift in your projects, existing or new. Further on, the book will demonstrate the unbelievable ease of configuring asynchronous behavior and other aspects of the app that are traditionally considered to be hard to implement and maintain. It will explain what Rx is made of, and how to switch to reactive way of thinking to get the most out of it. Also, test production code using RxTest and the red/ green approach. Finally, the book will dive into real-world recipes and show you how to build a real-world app by applying the reactive paradigm.

By the end of the book, youâ€™ll be able to build a reactive swift application by leveraging all the concepts this book takes you through.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
use_frameworks!
target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
pod 'RxSwift'
pod 'RxCocoa'
end
```

We assume that you, the reader of this book, already have intermediate knowledge of Swift programming language and have worked on iOS applications before.
